4
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:40,050
Chow time!

5
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:41,294
It's time!

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,930
Floyd, step up to the door.
Dinner time.

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,212
Only my friends call me Floyd.

8
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:52,524
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

9
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,120
What's that?

10
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:56,932
That is called loaf.

11
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:57,682
A loaf!

12
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,431
It's got a little bit of pasghetti in there.

13
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,016
Toenails.

14
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:02,926
Rat shit.

15
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:04,986
Everything a growing fella needs, like you.

16
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,630
- Come hear. Can I tell you something? Can I tell a secret?
- yeah

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,609
One day ...

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,509
Somehow, Someway,
I'm gonna get outta here.

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,220
And I'm gonna rain down on you,
like the Holy Ghost.

20
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,937
Man, you just threatened a staff number.

21
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:23,850
Yeah?

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,257
Yeah, you have.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,308
Do something.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,563
Let's have some fun.

25
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,893
Open a goddamn gate!

26
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,917
Come on guys. Don't waste my time.

27
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,690
Sector C! Pat attention!
Boss is on deck!

28
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:08,948
Open!

29
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,543
Bravo 14, Open perimeter fence.
Stay Back!

30
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,072
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,574
You gonna come down from there or what?

32
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,007
Look at you.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,357
You know the rules, hotness.

34
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:27,931
You gotta keep off these bars.

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,769
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

36
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,096
Oh, my good.

37
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,499
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady!

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,403
Can you come in here and tell me that?

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,929
or are you too scared?

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,909
Come on, I'm bored.

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,759
I'm bored, play with me.

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,757
You put five of my guards in the hospital, honey.

43
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,776
No one's gonna play with you.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,639
You sleep on the ground.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,710
I sleep where I want, when I want, with who I want.

46
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,109
Oh man. I love you.

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,180
Alpha one ...

48
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,393
hit her

49
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,450
Come on man. You're 6 6 foot four.
She's a tiny little girl.

50
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,599
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

51
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,235
We got chocolate, strawberry or vanilla.

52
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:15,708
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,815
Spring break!

54
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,510
That is just a whole lot of pretty in a whole lot of crazy.

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,462
The world changed when Superman
flew across the sky.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,438
And it changed again when he didn't.

57
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,652
Remember.

58
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,740
And that is why I'm here.

Hello Amanda.

61
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,880
We lose a national hero ...

62
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:33,009
but you sit there looking like the cat that ate the canary.

63
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,536
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,719
It's taken some work.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,180
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

66
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,630
There's rumors, Amanda ...

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,321
Some of them have abilities.

68
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,960
The rumors are right.

69
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,159
You know what a problem with a metahuman is?

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,512
The human part.

71
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,479
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

72
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,455
The next Superman might not.

73
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,075
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

74
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:02,035
I'm fighting fire with fire.

75
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,339
You are not going to pitch us that
 Task Force X project of yours again, are you?

76
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,748
Yes

77
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,472
But this time, you're gonna listen.

78
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,871
Floyd Lawton, AKA Deadshot.

79
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,603
He is the most wanted hitman in the world.

80
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,605
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

81
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,625
- What?
- Hey Angelo.

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,977
This is the exterminator you called for your rat problem.

83
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:49,363
My account's looking a little thin.

84
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,537
No one gets paid until what needs to get done, gets done.

85
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,025
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, No honey.

86
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,270
Wow! Here is your boy right now.

87
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,238
With about 20 of his new best friends.

88
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,595
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

89
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,190
Listen. Stop being cute and do your job!

90
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,803
They're taking him outta the car now.

91
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:17,051
In about 30 seconds, your window is gonna close forever.

92
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,317
Okay, Okay, Okay. Relax.

93
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,884
There was an accounting error.

94
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:22,044
We sent it.

95
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:25,599
Now double it for being an dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

96
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,582
- We're not the kind of people you play with.
- Did you threaten me?

97
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,250
This dude's gonna get a sore throat.
From all the singing he's about to do.

98
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,441
You son of a bitch.

99
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,027
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

100
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,071
But everyone has a weakness.
and a weakness can be leveraged.

101
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,392
His is an 11- year- old honor student in Gotham city.
His daughter.

102
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,849
So we watched her and waited.

103
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,674
You should talk to Mama more.

104
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,745
Yeah, yeah. I know

105
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,723
Mama stays in bed a lot.

106
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:15,043
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

107
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,129
Dad, it's okay, I can take care of her.

108
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,497
I know how to make pancakes now.

109
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,295
Hey babe, That's beautiful.

110
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,238
She's supposed to be taking care of you.
That's how that's supposed to work.

111
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,410
I want you to come and live with me.

112
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,914
All right? I came into some resources. I'mma get us spot.

113
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,184
It's gonna be nice, all right?

114
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,464
Mama says I can't live with you because you kill people.

115
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:44,790
That's not true, That's a lie. She is lying to you.

116
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,121
Daddy ...

117
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,309
I know you do bad things.

118
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,379
Don't worry. I still love you.

119
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,920
Come on.

120
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,281
And you caught him?

121
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:58,955
Not me.

122
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:02,791
I just gave an anonymous tip the right guy in the Gotham city.

123
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:03,931
I'mma figure this out.

124
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,830
All right?

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,389
It's over, Headshot.

126
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,490
I do not want to do this
in front of your daughter.

127
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,047
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,909
Please daddy. Don't do it.

129
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,036
Please.

130
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,800
Don't do it.

131
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,108
All right.

132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,879
Love you, daddy.

133
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,679
So now we have the man who never misses.

134
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,918
Where'd you put him?

135
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,946
Let's just say. I put him in a hole and threw away the hole.

136
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,244
Harley Quinn.

137
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,282
Before she ran off and joined the circus ...

138
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,117
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

139
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,469
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,368
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

141
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,139
Dr. Quinzel.

142
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,938
You know, I lived for these moments with you.

143
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,545
What do you get?

144
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,869
I got you a kitty.

145
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:36,922
So thoughtful.

146
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,681
She thought she was curing him ...

147
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,912
But, She was falling in love.

148
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,235
There is something you could do
for me ...

149
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,251
Doctor

150
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,593
Anything. I mean, yeah.

151
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,710
I need a machine gun.

152
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,207
A Machine gun?

153
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,002
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

154
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:11,305
Get off me!

155
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,387
What do we have here?

156
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,204
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me Mr.J?

157
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,335
What?

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,258
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya

159
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,949
I'm just gonna hurt ya ...

160
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,729
really, really bad.

161
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,619
You think so?

162
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,018
Well, I can take it.

163
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,535
They became the king and the queen of Gotham city.

164
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,993
And god help anyone who disrespected the queen.

165
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,380
- We finally meet.
- He ain't shake hands.

166
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:58,526
But sit down and have a drink.

167
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,062
Hey, J.

168
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:06,406
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

169
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:09,224
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.

170
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,209
You're making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

171
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,666
Are you sweet talkin' me?

172
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,690
I love this guy.

173
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,140
He's so intense!

174
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,059
You're lucky man.

175
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,450
You got a bad bitch.

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,149
Oh, that she is.

177
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
The fire in my loins.

178
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,019
The itch in my pants.

179
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:48,410
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

180
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,890
Oh, come to Daddy.

181
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,762
Puddin''!

182
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:09,679
Listen! You are my gift to
 this handsome hunka hunka!

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,030
You belong to him now.

184
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,739
You're cute!

185
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,979
You want me?

186
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,330
I'm all yours.

187
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,524
I don't want no beef.

188
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,818
You don't want no beef?
You don't want ..

189
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,264
Why, what's wrong? ( dont't wanna beef?)
You don't like me?

190
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,076
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

191
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,403
This is your lady.

192
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,522
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

193
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,447
No.

194
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,454
- That's your lady, Joker!
- That's right!

195
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:45,790
You, J!

196
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,323
And, That was just the beginning.

197
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,180
Come on, Puddin''. Do it!

198
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,255
Oh ...

199
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,110
- We have got company.
- Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

200
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,009
She is crazier than him.

201
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,784
And more fearless.

202
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:18,331
Stupid Bat, You're ruining date night!

203
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:21,844
Puddin''.

204
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,582
Puddin'', I can't swimmmmm!

205
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,364
And the Bat got her, too.

206
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:08,616
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

207
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:24,064
And then there's the Aussie.

208
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:25,648
Digger Harkness.

209
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,570
Or as the tabloids call him : Capitan Boomerang.

210
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,437
We're gonna be rich.

211
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:42,948
Yeah, you and me, mate.
Go and get the car.

212
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,813
He robbed every bank in Australia.at least once.

213
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,769
Then he came to America for a fresh target set.

214
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,870
Doesn't work well with others.

215
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,782
No honor among thieves, ha?

216
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:04,872
But he tangled with a metahuman and,
lived to tell about it.

217
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:08,593
And have you heard of
 the pyro kinetic homeboy?

218
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,623
How'd you catch him?

219
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,873
We did not. He surrendered.

220
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,439
Chato Santana. On the street they call him El Diablo.

221
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:24,388
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world ...

222
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,052
until he lost his queen.

223
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,552
Gets jumped in prison riot and
incinerates half the yard.

224
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,844
The security video is incredible.

225
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,117
Oh, Jesus.

226
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,216
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.

227
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,608
KC, dinner.

228
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,237
Open it up, B.

229
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,545
Evolution took a step backwards with this one.

230
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,885
Give me that, Smitty.

231
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,065
Where you at?

232
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,488
They call him Killer Croc.

233
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,566
He looked like a monster.

234
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:05,072
So they treated him like a monster.

235
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,652
Then he became a monster

236
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,421
He was chased out of Gotham by the bat.

237
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,158
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

238
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,849
He never found it.

239
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,146
I saved the best for last.

240
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,507
- The witch.
- A witch?

241
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:33,927
I'm talking a flying, spell- casting,
making- shit- disappear witch.

242
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,106
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

243
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,657
Archaeologist doctor June Moone ...

244
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,092
Wondered into the wrong cave.

245
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,856
June ...

246
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,963
She opened something she shouldn't have ...

247
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,724
releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

248
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,310
The Enchantress.

249
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,850
She inhabits Dr.Moone's body now.

250
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,409
Where is this witch?

251
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,782
In my pocket.

252
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,179
Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.

253
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,924
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart ...

254
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:37,605
and whoever finds it, can control the witch.

255
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,655
So we searched the cave where she turned up ...

256
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:41,419
and we found her heart.

257
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:46,247
That thing's her heart?

258
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,769
She is vulnerable without it.

259
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,178
You want to put our national security in the hands of ...

260
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,569
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

261
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,409
- Don't forget about the Joker's girlfriend.
- These are villains Amanda.

262
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,491
What makes you think you can control them?

263
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,767
Because getting people to act
against their own self- interests ...

264
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:06,460
for the national security of the U.S is what I do for a living.

265
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:10,794
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced ...

266
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,297
Colonel Rick Flag.

267
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,992
Help me.

268
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,529
I assigned him to watch Dr.Moone,
and just as I hoped ...

269
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,322
it got personal.

270
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,378
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

271
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,013
I have the witch's heart.

272
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:48,134
And Dr.Moone has his.

273
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:52,364
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

274
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,411
In a world of flying men and monsters ...

275
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,276
this is the only way to protect our country.

276
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:09,751
What if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the White House ...

277
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,871
and grab the president of the US right out of the Overall office?

278
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,936
Who would've stopped him?

279
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,325
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea ...

280
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,807
anthrax in our mail. We got fluoride in our water.

281
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,904
But what happens if
the next Superman ...

282
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,998
becomes a terrorist?

283
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,976
Amanda Waller has a plan.
Amanda?

284
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:33,919
I want to build a team of some very bad people
who I think can do some good.

285
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,638
Like fight a next war,
defeat the next Superman.

286
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,185
Not on my watch.

287
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:41,814
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

288
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,859
General, we run them covertly non-attributed.
Strictly need to know.

289
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,656
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus

290
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:53,193
The next war will be fought
with these meta humans. Ours or Theirs.

291
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,773
We're not the only ones kicking up rocks looking for them.

292
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:58,068
You know we can't control these people.

293
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,080
June, Be strong!

294
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:07,658
Dr.Moone.

295
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:34,556
Enchantress

296
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,763
Meet the Enchantress.

297
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:54,020
Everything we know about her,
is in your briefing packs.

298
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,869
She's walked this earth
for a very long time ...

299
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,312
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

300
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:02,010
This meeting is ... is now a magic show?

301
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:05,272
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

302
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,575
Go get it, girl.

303
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:29,179
How about a little something from
the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

304
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:41,444
We've been chasing these plans for years.

305
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,710
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

306
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:47,882
Thank you. We'd like Dr.Moone back.

307
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,906
Enchantress.

308
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,985
Please, Please.

309
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,504
I'm sorry. I can' ... I can't do that again.
I can' ...

310
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,190
Flag, get her out of here.

311
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,951
I move to ...

312
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:15,729
authorize Amanda Waller to establish
"Task Force X" under the Argus program.

313
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:18,998
All right.

314
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,639
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

315
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Welcome to Belle Reve, special security barracks.
How you doing man?

316
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,192
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She is in charge.

317
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:40,299
Welcome, ma'am.
How are you?

318
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:42,476
I'm here to assist you in anyway.

319
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:44,360
Where are they?

320
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,339
Are you the Devil?

321
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,516
Maybe.

322
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,575
Ain't you scared?

323
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,862
Why'd they put you down here?

324
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,176
I asked.

325
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,015
You. ese

326
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:58,039
Hola, amigo.

327
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,898
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

328
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,331
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

329
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,788
Then come down here.

330
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:19,136
That ain't me.

331
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,237
That wasn't you?

332
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:22,217
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.

333
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,543
That guy's gone.

334
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,042
He's dead.

335
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,572
And yet, here you are.

336
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:27,230
Ma'am.

337
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:28,701
Let me try to talk to him.

338
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,638
You wanna die in here buddy?

339
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,418
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.

340
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:41,367
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

341
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:42,689
A Women.

342
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:43,905
Look, man ...

343
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,724
You ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

344
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,257
Ask what?

345
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,034
I'm a man. Okay?

346
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,267
I ain't no weapon.

347
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,416
I'mmna die in peace before
I raise my fists again.

348
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:58,734
I've caused enough harm.

349
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,152
All right, unlock him.

350
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,393
What?

351
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:11,574
You heard me.

352
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:12,857
You know what this man can do?

353
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:16,224
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.

354
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:22,470
OK.

355
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,733
What is this?

356
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,768
Cheerleading tryouts?

357
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,864
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

358
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,873
They say you never missed a shot.

359
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,242
Prove it.

360
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,851
Now you got one in the chamber.

361
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:48,632
What you gonna do with it?

362
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,116
- Hhhh ... Hey
- Shit.

363
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:52,936
Give me the word, boss.
I'll drop him.

364
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,103
Everybody calm down.

365
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:56,128
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

366
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:57,335
Tell them : "Put it down".

367
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:57,828
Stand down.

368
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:01,480
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

369
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:02,313
What's for dinner?

370
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,320
Ames, if this man shoots me ...

371
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:06,194
I want you to kill him ...

372
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:08,822
And I want you to go and clear my browser history.

373
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,212
See ...

374
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,999
the firing pin is filed down, right?

375
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,573
Mag full of dummy rounds.

376
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:17,673
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

377
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,283
You're absolutely right.

378
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,169
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

379
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:24,771
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

380
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:27,248
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

381
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:29,256
I've known you, like, nine months.

382
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:32,011
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was real cookie.

383
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,074
What?

384
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,285
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

385
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,286
All right.
Now you know what you're buyin'.

386
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,310
Let me tell you the price. first ...

387
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,015
I want outta here.

388
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:41,337
Second, I want full custody of my daughter.

389
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:43,406
All right?
And her mom can have, like ...

390
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:46,528
supervised visits. But, her boyfriend can't come.

391
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:48,033
Darnell can't come.

392
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,665
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

393
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,744
Third, y'all gonna pay for my daughter's whole education.

394
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:55,496
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

395
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:57,308
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

396
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:59,224
- So Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.

397
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,745
One of them big joints, you know?

398
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,838
And if she can't cut it ...

399
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,679
and her grades start slipping, I need you to
white- people that thing. You know how y'all do.

400
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,287
- Oh yeah.
- You know, right? Ok.

401
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,871
Now that's my price.
But I'm concerned ...

402
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,915
'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

403
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:15,857
You're in no position
to make any demands.

404
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,986
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

405
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,578
No, errand boy.

406
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:22,612
I'm talking to your boss.

407
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,041
That's my price, sweetie.

408
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,761
You know what it is.

409
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:33,507
You notice these are criminals?

410
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:37,552
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

411
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,655
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you ...

412
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,538
a team of pipe hitters who'll do
anything you can dream up.

413
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,885
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

414
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:46,577
In WW2, the US Navy made a deal with he mafia ...

415
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,497
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

416
00:28:48,564 --> 00:28:49,795
This ain't WW2.

417
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,567
It's WW3.

418
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,400
What are you really up to?

419
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,336
It's a "need- to- know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.

420
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:58,115
That can change with a phone call.

421
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,587
I have friends, too. You know.

422
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,651
There you go. Call'em.

423
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:06,552
But without you minding
her, your lady friend stays

424
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,521
here strapped to a board
in a drug- induced coma.

425
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,586
They warned me about you.

426
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:16,601
I didn't believe the stories.

427
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,658
Nobody does.

428
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:34,878
Where is she?

429
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,933
It's complex. This is not just her.

430
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,772
Everybody's disappeared.

431
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,393
This new law,
where if you're a bad enough, bad guy

432
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:43,914
they stamp "Terrorist" on your jacket.

433
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:46,786
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.

434
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,487
A black site.

435
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,392
That's where she is.

436
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,407
So what are we doni'?

437
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,471
bring the car around.

438
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,290
We're going for a drive.

439
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,538
Lester! Lester!
Hit me one more time!

440
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,641
Come on, Man

441
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,559
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10k.

442
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:30,577
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

443
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:36,779
Good job, Man.

444
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,009
He's killin' it.

445
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,461
Come on Man. Why am I here?

446
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,516
All right! Yeah! I'm down.
I get it! All right?

447
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:44,638
I've had run of bad decks.
Not my fault.

448
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:45,619
All right?

449
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:47,471
Dude, this is real.

450
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,974
I had to stop these guys from burning down
your house with your kids in it.

451
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:56,877
But, you're lucky.

452
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,606
Maybe. Why do you think so?

453
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,514
You. Slick, what's up?

454
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:08,445
Griggs. You are ...?

455
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,469
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

456
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:11,883
Can I go, man?

457
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,056
What the hell's going on, man?

458
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,456
This is crazy.

459
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:23,136
All of that chitchat's gonna get you hurt.

460
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,404
My God!!!

461
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:46,435
I could tell you meant that.

462
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:47,597
Yeah.

463
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,323
You're gonna be my friend.

464
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,659
Enchantress.

465
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,747
- Log time of death. 16:20
- June?

466
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:30,392
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?

467
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:31,712
June?

468
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,515
June.

469
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,195
June.

470
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,224
What did you do?

471
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,033
OK.

472
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,755
Sister.

473
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,220
Brother.

474
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,603
Pus, it could be the routing number.

475
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:25,712
Wanna go for drinks?

476
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:41,050
Brother I have freed you.

477
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,765
Where are we?

478
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,619
The same world only much later

479
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,224
What happened?

480
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:55,447
The humans turned against us

481
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:59,047
But they worshipped us?

482
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:02,081
We were gods to them

483
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,547
Now they worship machines

484
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:09,240
So I will build a machine

485
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:13,287
That will destroy them all

486
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:15,831
Build your strength

487
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:17,123
Feed on them

488
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:20,087
And wait for me to return.

489
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:25,244
Enchantress.

490
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,159
God damn it!

491
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,549
June! June!

492
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,442
June! I'm sorry.

493
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,997
She went somewhere.

494
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:53,219
If you have to choose between her or me ...

495
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,902
stop her.

496
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,166
Promise me you'll stop her.

497
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,502
Even if it kills me.

498
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,242
Sir?

499
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:31,910
Sir, You okay?

500
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,249
Can you breathe?

501
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:35,145
Did you take anything?

502
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:38,473
This is 21. Send medical to my location.

503
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:40,353
I'm a physician.

504
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,455
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

505
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,815
No pulse. Starting compressions.

506
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,227
Sir

507
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,051
Midway city is under attack.

508
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:16,369
It's a non- human entity.

509
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:18,210
I think you know what to do, sir.

510
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,260
Activate Task Force X ...

511
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,350
and get Amanda Waller and her whole circus on scene ASAP.
(ASAP = as soon as possible)

512
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,321
Sir

513
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:28,125
We're gonna live with Task Force X. Pull'em.

514
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,404
Prisoners, get down on your knees. now!

515
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,350
Down on your knees! Hands in the air!
Turn around.

516
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:38,190
Hands up high!

517
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:39,879
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

518
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:42,049
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

519
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,195
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

520
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,931
Damn it!

521
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:52,221
Open the gate!

522
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,063
Everybody, line up for extraction.

523
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,940
Let's go! Let's move, move!

524
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,965
Yeah! Open the door! Let's go!

525
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,430
Hit him!

526
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:08,081
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

527
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:10,543
Where you at?

528
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:18,804
Is that the new guy?

529
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:24,592
What is that?

530
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:26,154
What is that?

531
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:28,222
- Who are you?
- Standby. Arming device.

532
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,379
Who are you? I don't know who you are.

533
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:30,240
Device armed.

534
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,935
Hey ... I'm talking to you.
Hey ... I'm talking to you.

535
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:34,973
injection Successful.

536
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:37,123
Location verified.

537
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:39,969
Anybody who touches me is dead.

538
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,323
Anybody who ...

539
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:42,923
lady.

540
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:44,358
injection Successful.

541
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,175
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

542
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,284
Next!

543
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:50,768
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

544
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,904
Come on.

545
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:56,457
Shut up, and get it done.

546
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,831
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

547
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,234
It's from Mr. J.

548
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,873
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

549
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:07,608
You're so screwed.

550
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,515
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

551
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:10,671
Get off me! Get off me!

552
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,118
Harley, what do you mean by that?

553
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,325
Harley!!!

554
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,286
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr.Van Criss.

555
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,414
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

556
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,907
Cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

557
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,198
Thank you. You're a good man.

558
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,135
Open up.

559
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:56,883
Just please, do whatever they say.

560
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,176
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

561
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:12,152
This look neat.

562
00:39:18,544 --> 00:39:20,580
Light it up! Light it up! Light it up!

563
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,499
He's right above us.

564
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,719
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.

565
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,078
- I can't d ...
- Listen ... Listen

566
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,756
There is no other way.

567
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:39,037
Just get it done.

568
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,770
Just get it done.

569
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:47,580
Enchantress.

570
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:49,701
Flag, talk to me.
What' going on down there?

571
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,823
Amanda, she is bolted.

572
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,270
Say it again?

573
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:55,801
She is bolted.

574
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:57,548
Shit!

575
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,832
Brother help me.

576
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:08,499
Before she kills me.

577
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,258
Where's your heart?

578
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,503
I will take it back.

579
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,849
Untill then you will share your power.

580
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,894
Now help me build my weapon.

581
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,041
It's time to wipe them out.

582
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,825
Go!

583
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:14,084
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

584
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:15,932
I thought this was contained!

585
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:23,014
Guys. I need all three of you follow me please.

586
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:26,568
Anybody with blood.

587
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:33,545
This is the worst day of my life.

588
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:38,286
All evacuees must report
to a FEMA representative.

589
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:41,751
What's going on in that city?

590
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:43,813
Those assholes here yet?

591
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:46,053
Yeah. They're here.

592
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,921
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

593
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,763
What the hell, Flag?

594
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:58,340
Unlock'em.

595
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:09,000
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

596
00:42:09,283 --> 00:42:10,549
How do you do?

597
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:17,472
Haaah?

598
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:19,077
What was that?

599
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:21,331
I should kill everyone and escape?

600
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,956
Sorry. The voices.

601
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,945
I'm kidding. jeez!

602
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,187
That's not what they really said.

603
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:33,911
What do we got here?

604
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:36,818
12 pounds of shit in a 10- pound sack.

605
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:44,391
Welcome to party, Capitan Boomerang.

606
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,724
Hey, hey, hey ... What's going on, man?

607
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,004
Calm down.

608
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:54,260
Hey, one minute I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna ...

609
00:42:54,415 --> 00:42:56,593
then this red streak hits me outta nowhere.

610
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,233
Shut up! You were caught robbing a diamond exchange.

611
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:00,706
I was not.

612
00:43:02,557 --> 00:43:03,656
Here comes Slipknot ...

613
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:06,573
the man who climb anything. Wonderful.

614
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:08,353
Have a good time, scumbag.

615
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:11,900
Straighten up!

616
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,634
She had a mouth.

617
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:17,897
Listen up!

618
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:19,978
In your necks ...

619
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:23,990
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

620
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:25,588
as the size of a rice grain ...

621
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:27,740
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

622
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,115
You disobey me, you die.

623
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:35,259
You try to escape, you die.

624
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,843
You otherwise irritate or vex me, and guess what?

625
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:41,518
You die.

626
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:44,899
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

627
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:46,216
Lady, shut up!

628
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:48,407
This is the deal.

629
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,551
You're going somewhere very bad ...

630
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:53,919
to do something that'll get you killed.

631
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,450
But until that happens ...

632
00:43:56,795 --> 00:43:58,239
you're my problem.

633
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:02,146
So was that like a pep talk?

634
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:03,661
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

635
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:05,589
There's your shit.

636
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:08,148
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

637
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,648
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

638
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,138
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

639
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,497
He's like a gold standard. OK?

640
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:17,206
Triangle, bitch. Study
(Kind of strategy for effective attacking in basketball)

641
00:45:19,923 --> 00:45:20,984
What?

642
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:28,940
Won't fit anymore?

643
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:32,136
Too much junk in the trunk?

644
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:36,251
Nah. Every time I put this on, somebody dies.

645
00:45:37,503 --> 00:45:38,404
And?

646
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:41,047
I like putting it on.

647
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:42,957
Goody.

648
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,425
Somethin' tells me a whole lotta
 people are about to die.

649
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,862
Yeah. It's us.

650
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,411
We're being led to our deaths.

651
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:50,755
Speak for yourself mate.

652
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:53,293
Hey, what's that crop on your face?
Does it wash off?

653
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,920
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?

654
00:45:57,972 --> 00:45:59,628
because that would be real classy.

655
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:02,283
Hey, y'all might wanna leave old boy alone.

656
00:46:02,436 --> 00:46:04,560
He could torch this whole joint.

657
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:05,853
Ain't right, ese?

658
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:08,403
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.

659
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,946
I'm cool, homie.

660
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:12,141
Behold the voice of god.

661
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:16,802
For those of you who
don't know me officially ...

662
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,657
My Name is Amanda Waller.

663
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,886
There's an active terrorist event in Midway City.

664
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:27,582
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT- 1 and get them to safety.

665
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:28,999
I'm sorry.

666
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,603
For those of us who don't speak good guy,
what is HVT- 1?

667
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,773
The only person that matters in the city ...

668
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,723
the one person you can't kill.

669
00:46:38,518 --> 00:46:41,393
Complete the mission, you get
time off your prison sentence.

670
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:43,241
Fail the mission, you die.

671
00:46:43,374 --> 00:46:45,115
Anything happens to Colonel Flag ...

672
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:46,952
I'll kill every single one of you.

673
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:49,732
Remember, I'm watching.

674
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:52,604
I see everything.

675
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,227
There's your pep talk.

676
00:46:57,488 --> 00:46:59,729
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

677
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:01,661
So that's it?

678
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:04,729
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

679
00:47:05,414 --> 00:47:07,706
I'll notify your next of kin.

680
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:11,568
Alpha, Bravo team, Mount up!

681
00:47:17,393 --> 00:47:18,486
Your' late.

682
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,551
I was busy.

683
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:32,965
Please have mercy.

684
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,298
Where was the mercy for my husband?

685
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,394
I didn't kill him.

686
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:39,498
But you watched.

687
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,407
Criminals deserve no mercy.

688
00:47:45,224 --> 00:47:46,257
This is Katana.

689
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,708
She's got my back.

690
00:47:47,808 --> 00:47:51,010
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke ...

691
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,302
Just like mowing the lawn.

692
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,663
I would advise not getting killed by her.

693
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:58,959
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

694
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:02,039
Harley Quinn.
Nice to meet ya.

695
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,840
Love your perfume.

696
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,978
What is that? The stench of death?

697
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:10,215
- Should I kill them?
- Easy cowgirl.

698
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:12,671
Ain't that kind of mission.
Have a seat..

699
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:14,603
She seems nice.

700
00:48:27,215 --> 00:48:30,431
I'm coming for you.

701
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,128
Look at that pretty lights!

702
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:53,967
Are you guys seein' this?

703
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:56,622
What happened?

704
00:48:58,516 --> 00:49:00,056
Terror attack.

705
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:03,690
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

706
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,657
You know, usual shit.

707
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:06,757
Right.

708
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,529
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

709
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:11,770
I don't know if they told you ...

710
00:49:11,902 --> 00:49:15,077
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

711
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:16,676
Anything for a dollar, right?

712
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:19,996
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

713
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,809
I'm a soldier!

714
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,081
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

715
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,577
When the shooting starts ...

716
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:30,094
and it will,
you'll cut and run.

717
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:45,629
Six- one is going down.

718
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,950
Six- one is going down hard.

719
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:03,585
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

720
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,412
What a ride!

721
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:17,935
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

722
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:36,507
Mind games.

723
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:39,474
What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.

724
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,706
That ain't real, mate

725
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:44,773
See. they're trying to trap us
with our own minds. right?

726
00:50:44,894 --> 00:50:47,999
But you look around, we're free, brah.

727
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:49,385
How do you know this?

728
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:51,560
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

729
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,466
Now I'm going.
because I got a life to live.

730
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,799
Question is, are you coming?

731
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:03,026
Yeah! Smart!

732
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,956
Hold your fire.

733
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,176
Sorry. It's what I do.

734
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:42,933
Damn it.

735
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:46,299
Now that's a killer app!

736
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,640
Okay. you wanna keep playing ...

737
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,237
the Hollywood Squares version of
"I'll Blow your freaking Head Off?"

738
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:52,647
Are you next?

739
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:54,516
You tripping, homie.

740
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:56,769
You next, Deadshot?

741
00:52:00,093 --> 00:52:01,093
You just threatened me?

742
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:02,546
Oh, yeah.

743
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,878
He just threatened me.

744
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:09,460
Move.

745
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:11,598
You got a boyfriend?

746
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:16,716
I'm gonna kill him.

747
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:20,222
Well, you better make it quick
'cause he's gonna kill all of us one by one.

748
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:23,355
I'm gonna drop him. the sword lady.
five or seven of these SEALs.

749
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:25,212
After that, I'm gonna need some help.
you down?

750
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,795
Always. What about
the shit in our necks?

751
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,283
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

752
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,228
You're my friend, too.

753
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,461
Stay evil, doll face, Spread the word.

754
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,755
I'm standing by for follow on tasking.

755
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:59,082
C2, what is the operational load of the PLS?

756
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,953
Boss, we got people up here.

757
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:03,356
I'm on my way.

758
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,049
Shit!

759
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:19,103
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

760
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,696
Flag. get out of there.

761
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:23,360
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

762
00:53:23,564 --> 00:53:24,564
Copy that.

763
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,568
We're diverting.

764
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:29,325
Bump out second two squad two blocks east.

765
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,631
We'll pass through you ...

766
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:31,887
continue north.

767
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:33,900
Take Bravo two blocks east.

768
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:35,690
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

769
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:36,697
Copy that.

770
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:47,255
Hey. I like these odds, mate.

771
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:48,609
You just say the word.

772
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:49,739
Yeah.

773
00:53:50,451 --> 00:53:51,451
Come on.

774
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:52,821
Yeah.

775
00:53:53,326 --> 00:53:54,739
Hold that thought.

776
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,508
Rick, why do they look like that?

777
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:07,593
Just stay cool.

778
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:21,514
The hell are they?

779
00:54:22,257 --> 00:54:24,770
You cut run.
I'll blow your head off.

780
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:37,261
Hit'em!

781
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:35,275
Hey.

782
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:02,195
Get off me!

783
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:07,849
Get off me! Son of a ...

784
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,210
Flag!

785
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:15,920
- Good riddance
- Harley

786
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,940
He dies. we die.

787
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:31,007
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

788
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:34,481
Backblast, clear!

789
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:24,504
Pinky.

790
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:31,132
That's how I cut and run.

791
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:39,754
Hey.

792
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:41,233
Hey. come on.

793
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:43,400
What? I saw it move.

794
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:47,108
See? It flinched.
I think.

795
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,012
Hey. you were some help. princess.

796
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,909
It's better this way.

797
00:57:52,357 --> 00:57:53,357
Trust me.

798
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh, yeah you're the fire bloke. eh?

799
00:57:55,615 --> 00:57:56,095
Yeah, I was. Yeah.

800
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,769
Right. Yeah. Hey.

801
00:57:58,973 --> 00:58:00,040
Well. look at here.

802
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,685
It's fire.

803
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:06,585
[???] terrorist

804
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:08,792
You want to explain this?

805
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,281
If I told you, would you believe me?

806
00:58:11,918 --> 00:58:13,745
- What are they?
- I don't know.

807
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,185
That's bullshit.

808
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,409
This guy had a 3000$ watch.

809
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,095
Is that a Person?

810
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,003
It was.

811
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:24,963
Now it's not.

812
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,496
Hey, don't.

813
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:29,079
What?

814
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,425
We got a job to do.

815
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:35,981
Keep movin'.

816
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:39,836
Get your boys moving.

817
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:43,799
Let's go.

818
00:58:52,436 --> 00:58:54,164
Waller, we are moving on the objective.

819
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,447
We have lost contact with Bravo.
you got the visual?

820
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,124
Stand by.

821
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,333
Anything on the squadron?

822
00:58:58,596 --> 00:58:59,415
No ma'am.

823
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,294
Code7 I need your sensors
in those coordinates.

824
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,253
Flag, it's a negative.

825
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,552
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

826
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:32,678
Now you belong to my army

827
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,223
Seriously?

828
00:59:44,423 --> 00:59:46,160
What the hell is wrong with you people?

829
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,225
We're bad guys.
It's what we do.

830
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:12,829
Take a knee.

831
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:19,792
Our body's at the top of that building.

832
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:21,430
We get up there ...

833
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,933
Pull them out of
the vault they're hiding in.

834
01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:24,907
Helos extract us off the roof.

835
01:00:24,943 --> 01:00:26,720
- It's miller times.
- Check

836
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:40,434
Waller?

837
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,086
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

838
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:49,741
What do say we get this over with?

839
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,175
What the hell? Deadshot.

840
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:52,562
Fall back.

841
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:00,187
You mind if we tag along?

842
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,786
look like we have a spot of luck.eh?

843
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,442
Be a walk in the park.

844
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,228
Easy peasy.

845
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:22,467
Don't make me shoot you.

846
01:01:27,612 --> 01:01:29,568
God damn it. Harley!

847
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:31,176
Go! Go! Go! Go!

848
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:37,768
I am coming to my lady ...

849
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,433
Hey, guys!

850
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,412
Come on. Let's go.

851
01:02:37,815 --> 01:02:41,492
Ma'am. I got motion detectors
going off on the secure floors.

852
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:44,730
Flag...

853
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,224
- They’re all around you.
- Hold

854
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:48,517
Use extreme caution.

855
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:51,424
I don’t like this, Flag.

856
01:02:53,215 --> 01:02:54,748
I don’t like it either.

857
01:02:59,245 --> 01:03:00,483
Pussy.

858
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,467
I will knock your ass out.

859
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,065
I do not care that you're a girl.

860
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,067
They're after Flag again.

861
01:03:57,351 --> 01:03:58,801
Get off me.

862
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:04,921
Circle up. Circle around him.

863
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:11,488
Let me fight!

864
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,874
You die. We die.

865
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:17,886
Clear! Everyone move out.

866
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,124
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain’t my fight!

867
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:36,905
You know what? You don’t stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

868
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:38,208
Don't touch me, man!

869
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,472
- Don’t touch you? What you gonna do?
- Don't touch me!

870
01:04:39,472 --> 01:04:41,487
I’m touching you! I’m touching you!

871
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:43,419
- Do something. Do something!
- Don’t touch me!

872
01:04:43,571 --> 01:04:44,699
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see ...

873
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,435
- You wanna see something?
- Yes I wanna see something.

874
01:05:11,356 --> 01:05:13,242
I was just trying to get you there.

875
01:05:14,467 --> 01:05:16,093
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

876
01:05:18,336 --> 01:05:20,812
I knew you'd come through.

877
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:22,894
That shit crazy.

878
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,150
Clear.

879
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:50,097
I gotta work on my cardio.

880
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:00,676
Question.

881
01:06:03,557 --> 01:06:05,398
Would you die for me?

882
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:08,500
Yes.

883
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:10,320
That's too easy.

884
01:06:11,307 --> 01:06:12,963
Would you ... ?

885
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,353
Would you live for me?

886
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:21,533
Yes

887
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,166
Careful.

888
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:29,453
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

889
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,473
Desire becomes surrender.

890
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:34,376
Surrender becomes power.

891
01:06:37,964 --> 01:06:39,634
Do you want this?

892
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:41,686
I do.

893
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:43,235
say it.

894
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:45,936
Say it. Say it.

895
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:48,691
Pretty, pretty, pretty ...

896
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,860
Please.

897
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:52,892
God, you're so ...

898
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:54,403
Good.

899
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:02,610
Relax.

900
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:03,617
Just me.

901
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:09,568
You ever been in love?

902
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:13,553
Nah. never.

903
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:14,891
Bullshit.

904
01:08:15,075 --> 01:08:18,792
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten

905
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,720
If you feel shit like love.

906
01:08:23,068 --> 01:08:25,290
Another textbook sociopath.

907
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:30,651
Clear.

908
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:31,969
Clear.

909
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:34,400
All right, secure the roof.

910
01:08:34,419 --> 01:08:37,349
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

911
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:38,651
Going to the roof.

912
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:47,357
Wait here.

913
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:48,516
Please.

914
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,986
I don't wanna gave this dude
a heart attack okay?

915
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,238
He's embarrassed of us.

916
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:55,268
Hey, Flag.

917
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:59,408
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

918
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:08,055
You ready? let's go.

919
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,400
You wouldn't have made it without them.

920
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:13,430
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

921
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:16,094
Admit it, rick. I was right.

922
01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:17,886
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.

923
01:09:17,962 --> 01:09:18,787
Why'd you say?

924
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:20,823
I was studying your girlfriend.

925
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:22,423
She takes an average person ...

926
01:09:22,564 --> 01:09:25,866
A yoga mom an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier

927
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:28,055
Who can take a headshot and still fight.

928
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:30,182
It's an instant army.

929
01:09:30,983 --> 01:09:32,383
How'd she do it. Flag?

930
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,202
How'd she game the system ...

931
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:36,287
With you watching her every move?

932
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:41,178
I'll accept the consequences

933
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,289
I am your consequence.

934
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:45,171
You might need to be careful.

935
01:09:45,603 --> 01:09:47,939
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

936
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,565
I can take care of myself.

937
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:51,580
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.

938
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:52,977
Copy that.

939
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:56,030
Hey, man I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped ...

940
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:59,120
In your temple of
soldierly self- righteousness ...

941
01:09:59,288 --> 01:10:02,490
But a two- faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

942
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,500
Oh, says the guy who shoots people for money.

943
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,895
My cards is on the table, man.

944
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,369
It got done. didn't it?

945
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:16,001
Damn. That is just ...

946
01:10:16,021 --> 01:10:18,506
A mean lady.

947
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:19,988
Yeah. You get used to it.

948
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:24,273
And I'm the bad guy?

949
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:28,949
That's gangsta.

950
01:10:30,947 --> 01:10:31,845
What?

951
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:33,551
They weren't cleared
for any of this any of it.

952
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,073
Hey. I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

953
01:10:47,178 --> 01:10:48,740
No way.

954
01:10:58,574 --> 01:10:59,574
Let's go home.

955
01:11:00,336 --> 01:11:01,536
Yeah. let's go home.

956
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:05,189
That sounds good.
you guys wanna go home?

957
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,500
Or you wanna go back to prison?

958
01:11:07,742 --> 01:11:09,565
I'm not going back to prison.

959
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,620
What I'm saying is ...

960
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:13,269
We kill the pair of 'em now
before they kill us.

961
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:14,824
I got this.

962
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:20,380
You all made it this far.

963
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:24,889
Don't get high- spirited on me
and run a good thing.

964
01:11:41,224 --> 01:11:42,224
I like her.

965
01:11:46,496 --> 01:11:47,120
Savior one- zero,

966
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,803
this is Ground Element.

967
01:11:52,212 --> 01:11:54,438
Savior one- zero,
how copy?

968
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:58,861
Savior one- zero, the LZ's clear.

969
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:05,978
Boss, they're not talking to me.

970
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:09,361
Our bird's been jacked.

971
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:11,339
Light it up!

972
01:12:38,058 --> 01:12:40,030
What? I got hickey or something?

973
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:42,760
Professor, could you pick up the pace?

974
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:46,932
Now!

975
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,413
Harley!

976
01:12:58,543 --> 01:12:59,543
Hello, baby.

977
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:03,605
Kill her!

978
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:07,417
Her nanite's disarmed!

979
01:13:09,575 --> 01:13:10,575
Come on, baby.

980
01:13:26,384 --> 01:13:27,384
Deadshot ...

981
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:30,336
Shoot that woman right now!

982
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,502
She ain't do shit to me.

983
01:13:32,596 --> 01:13:34,694
You're a hitman. right?

984
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,201
I got a contract.

985
01:13:36,276 --> 01:13:37,764
Kill Harley Quinn.

986
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,094
Do it your freedom
and your kid.

987
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:43,993
Now she dead.

988
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:24,418
I missed.

989
01:14:29,693 --> 01:14:30,693
Good one, mate.

990
01:14:31,111 --> 01:14:32,691
It's Waller.

991
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:36,821
Savior one- zero's been hijaked.
Shoot it down.

992
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:38,666
Rager that ma'am.
going hot.

993
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:47,532
Puddin'!

994
01:14:52,757 --> 01:14:54,905
You got all dressed up for me?

995
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:57,315
You know I'd do anything for you.

996
01:14:57,479 --> 01:14:57,986
By the way ...

997
01:14:58,324 --> 01:15:01,870
I've got some grape soda on ice,
and a bear skin rug waitin'.

998
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:02,878
Yeah?

999
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,714
Boss, we got a problem.

1000
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:13,538
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1001
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:18,133
Okay, honey. It’s me and you.

1002
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:18,748
Let’s do it.

1003
01:15:45,864 --> 01:15:47,198
Target destroyed, ma’am

1004
01:15:47,511 --> 01:15:49,824
Thank you.Now get me off this roof.

1005
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,269
Yes, ma'am.We are inbound.

1006
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,937
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1007
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:04,766
You couldn’t save her.

1008
01:16:09,237 --> 01:16:10,303
Roger.I see ya.

1009
01:16:13,645 --> 01:16:14,882
Watch your step. Ma’am.

1010
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:19,696
Stand by. I’ll send another helo!

1011
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,067
Waller's down.

1012
01:17:22,736 --> 01:17:23,736
It’s over.

1013
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:27,558
Ops just confirmed.
She’s down. 1k west.

1014
01:17:30,189 --> 01:17:31,884
Let’s go get her.

1015
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:38,937
The mission’s not over.

1016
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:42,316
Nah. It is for me.
We had a deal.

1017
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:44,587
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1018
01:18:30,596 --> 01:18:33,062
Hey, guys. I’m back!

1019
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:37,227
I missed you all so much.

1020
01:18:37,882 --> 01:18:40,014
We're glad you could make it.

1021
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:56,276
Hey, craziness.

1022
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:17,892
Bring me my sister’s heart.

1023
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:46,114
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1024
01:19:46,338 --> 01:19:50,262
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.

1025
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:52,611
Do your worst, bitch!

1026
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:22,071
So let me guess.

1027
01:20:23,275 --> 01:20:26,359
We’re going to the swirling
wing of trash in the sky.

1028
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:28,404
you know, 'cause why wouldn’t we?

1029
01:20:30,403 --> 01:20:32,915
When does this end, Flag?

1030
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,729
Load up.
We’re in for a fight.

1031
01:20:59,849 --> 01:21:03,033
You tell everybody everything.

1032
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:06,007
Or me and you are gonna go right now.

1033
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:13,263
Three days ago,

1034
01:21:13,271 --> 01:21:16,254
a non- human entity appeared in the subway station.

1035
01:21:17,626 --> 01:21:19,293
Waller, we’re almost there.

1036
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:23,249
So Waller sent me and
a woman with incredibles abilities.

1037
01:21:23,454 --> 01:21:25,206
Enchantress

1038
01:21:26,163 --> 01:21:27,163
A witch.

1039
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:30,170
See, nobody could get near this thing ...

1040
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:32,131
but the witch could.

1041
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,359
Bombs ready.

1042
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:38,757
Set for two seconds. You just
press the button and drop it.

1043
01:21:42,575 --> 01:21:45,486
Needless to say the whole thing was a bad idea.

1044
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:47,001
She bolted!

1045
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:48,716
Shit!

1046
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,744
Brother help me.

1047
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,305
And that’s how she escaped from Waller.

1048
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:03,285
So now you know.

1049
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,540
You can just kill me right now ...

1050
01:22:06,741 --> 01:22:09,608
but I'm going to have a drink.

1051
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:11,677
hey! Deadshot, I need your help.

1052
01:22:11,775 --> 01:22:14,476
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1053
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:52,256
Here’s to honor among thieves

1054
01:22:52,522 --> 01:22:53,522
I’m not a thief.

1055
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:58,023
Oh.She’s not a thief.

1056
01:23:02,798 --> 01:23:04,865
Well, we almost pulled it off ...

1057
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,560
Despite what everybody thought.

1058
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:12,567
Worst part of it is, they’re gonna
blame us for the whole thing.

1059
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:14,922
And they can’t have people
knowing the truth.

1060
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:17,059
We’re the patsies.

1061
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,572
The cover-up.

1062
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,168
Don’t forget, we’re the bad guys.

1063
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:30,168
For about two sweet seconds ...

1064
01:23:30,567 --> 01:23:31,567
I had hope.

1065
01:23:32,726 --> 01:23:33,859
You had hope huh?

1066
01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:39,165
Hope don’t stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.

1067
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:40,666
You preaching?

1068
01:23:40,794 --> 01:23:42,860
It’s coming back around for you.

1069
01:23:43,195 --> 01:23:45,891
How many people you killed, man?

1070
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,330
You don’t ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1071
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:51,425
You ain’t ever whacked down no women.

1072
01:23:51,561 --> 01:23:53,228
No kids.

1073
01:23:54,556 --> 01:23:56,606
I don’t kill women and children.

1074
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:57,841
I do.

1075
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:03,552
See, I was born with the Devil’s gift.

1076
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:06,334
I kept it hidden most of my life, but ...

1077
01:24:07,277 --> 01:24:10,451
The older I got, the stronger I got.

1078
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,532
So I started using it.

1079
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:15,400
for business, you know

1080
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:17,699
The more power on the street I got ...

1081
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:18,868
The more firepower I got.

1082
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:20,209
Like that shit went hand in hand.

1083
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:22,493
You know? One was feeding the other.

1084
01:24:23,606 --> 01:24:25,942
Ain’t nobody tell me no.

1085
01:24:27,009 --> 01:24:28,643
Except my old lady.

1086
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,415
You know, she used to pray for me.

1087
01:24:33,874 --> 01:24:34,934
You’re welcome.

1088
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:38,795
Even when I didn’t want it.

1089
01:24:49,003 --> 01:24:51,450
God didn’t give me this.

1090
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,184
Why should he take it away?

1091
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:55,941
Hey.

1092
01:24:58,279 --> 01:24:59,285
This is our home.

1093
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:01,107
You put that back where you found it.

1094
01:25:01,261 --> 01:25:03,009
I’m taking my kids to my Mom’s.

1095
01:25:03,091 --> 01:25:05,033
You ain’t taking my kids nowhere!

1096
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:08,987
See when I get mad, I lose
control you know, I just ...

1097
01:25:09,258 --> 01:25:10,258
I don’t know what I do ...

1098
01:25:17,556 --> 01:25:18,556
till it’s done.

1099
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:34,891
And the kids?

1100
01:25:38,402 --> 01:25:39,944
He killed them.

1101
01:25:43,925 --> 01:25:45,367
Didn’t you?

1102
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:55,317
Own that shit.

1103
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:57,085
Own it.

1104
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:59,554
What’d you think was
gonna happen? Huh?

1105
01:25:59,758 --> 01:26:01,676
Hey Harley, Come on.

1106
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:03,583
What you were just ...

1107
01:26:03,764 --> 01:26:04,879
Thinking you can have a happy family ...

1108
01:26:04,936 --> 01:26:08,069
And coach little leagues
and make car payments?

1109
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:12,942
Normal’s a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don’t get normal!

1110
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:15,223
Why is it always a knife fight…

1111
01:26:15,223 --> 01:26:18,051
every single time you open your mouth?

1112
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,602
You know, outside you’re amazing.

1113
01:26:24,571 --> 01:26:27,564
But inside, you’re ugly.

1114
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:29,446
We all are.

1115
01:26:29,554 --> 01:26:31,991
We all are!

1116
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:33,209
Except for him.

1117
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:36,670
He’s ugly on the outside, too.

1118
01:26:36,676 --> 01:26:38,675
Not me, shorty.

1119
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:44,773
I’m beautiful.

1120
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:47,497
Yeah, you are.

1121
01:26:57,448 --> 01:26:58,982
We don’t want you here.

1122
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:10,577
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1123
01:27:11,437 --> 01:27:12,437
Yeah.

1124
01:27:14,082 --> 01:27:17,061
I never been with a witch before.
What’s that like?

1125
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:24,223
Apparently that’s why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1126
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:26,499
‘Cause the witch is scared of him.

1127
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:28,886
The only woman I ever cared about ...

1128
01:27:28,888 --> 01:27:31,363
is trapped inside that monster.

1129
01:27:31,492 --> 01:27:36,262
If I don’t stop the witch, it’s over.
Everything is over.

1130
01:27:36,511 --> 01:27:37,511
Everything.

1131
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:42,412
You’re free to go.

1132
01:27:56,706 --> 01:27:59,773
Your daughter writes you everyday.

1133
01:28:02,598 --> 01:28:04,510
Every single day.

1134
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:22,083
You had these the whole time?

1135
01:28:23,585 --> 01:28:26,944
You had letters from my daughter the whole time?

1136
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:32,630
I’m gonna get you there.

1137
01:28:33,604 --> 01:28:35,271
And you’re gonna end this.

1138
01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:37,980
I’m gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1139
01:28:39,122 --> 01:28:42,708
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1140
01:28:42,714 --> 01:28:45,465
Everybody’s gonna know what we did.

1141
01:28:45,709 --> 01:28:49,103
And my daughter is
gonna know that her daddy…

1142
01:28:49,349 --> 01:28:51,912
is not a piece of shit.

1143
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:02,110
I'll come.

1144
01:29:05,884 --> 01:29:06,884
What?

1145
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:09,330
You got something better to do?

1146
01:29:09,332 --> 01:29:10,332
Come on!

1147
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:13,666
Pussies.

1148
01:29:49,394 --> 01:29:51,787
We think that thing's a weapon.

1149
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:52,834
Here. Lower.

1150
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:02,502
We gotta take out the big one.

1151
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:08,947
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1152
01:30:09,807 --> 01:30:11,239
There’s a flooded tunnel ...

1153
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:13,014
Leads right underneath that building.

1154
01:30:13,179 --> 01:30:17,713
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim underneath that things feet.

1155
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,985
We get in its face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch.

1156
01:30:20,985 --> 01:30:22,463
So the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1157
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,209
That’s how we take it out.

1158
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:38,478
I’m going with ya.

1159
01:30:40,151 --> 01:30:41,151
We got this.

1160
01:30:41,615 --> 01:30:44,510
I’m not asking bro.

1161
01:30:47,169 --> 01:30:49,602
I live underground.

1162
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:52,365
Y’all are just tourist.

1163
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:13,002
My dear husband if I die in battle.

1164
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,563
We will be together.

1165
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,208
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1166
01:31:21,194 --> 01:31:23,617
His souls trapped inside of it.

1167
01:31:24,441 --> 01:31:26,298
She talks to him.

1168
01:31:26,922 --> 01:31:27,922
Hey. well ...

1169
01:31:28,453 --> 01:31:31,156
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1170
01:31:32,373 --> 01:31:33,373
Huh?

1171
01:31:40,972 --> 01:31:41,972
Let’s do this.

1172
01:32:25,027 --> 01:32:26,627
You gonna fight with us?

1173
01:32:27,402 --> 01:32:28,935
What if I lose control?

1174
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,287
Then maybe we’ll have a chance.

1175
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:45,145
Duck in.

1176
01:32:57,601 --> 01:33:01,334
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff right?

1177
01:33:01,759 --> 01:33:02,759
Yeah why?

1178
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,597
I’m off my meds.

1179
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:08,878
That’s your old lady huh?

1180
01:33:09,203 --> 01:33:09,880
Yeah.

1181
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:12,553
Well, you need to handle this shit, alll right?

1182
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:14,638
Get up there, smack on her ass,

1183
01:33:14,741 --> 01:33:16,296
tell her : " knock this shit off".

1184
01:33:16,318 --> 01:33:18,318
I do not think that’d be wise.

1185
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:20,384
I’m gonna draw out the big one.

1186
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:23,488
My boys will detonate the bomb underneath him.

1187
01:33:27,365 --> 01:33:30,417
You know, we should
get a drink sometimes.

1188
01:33:30,586 --> 01:33:32,986
I’ve been waiting for you all night.

1189
01:33:35,144 --> 01:33:36,744
Step out of the shadows.

1190
01:33:37,032 --> 01:33:39,498
I won’t bite.

1191
01:33:43,115 --> 01:33:44,715
What the hell? Grab her.

1192
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:48,961
Why are you here?

1193
01:33:48,995 --> 01:33:51,998
Because the soldier led you?

1194
01:33:52,116 --> 01:33:53,917
And all for Waller?

1195
01:33:54,024 --> 01:33:57,050
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1196
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:58,113
I am your ally.

1197
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:02,242
And I know what you want.

1198
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:05,370
Exactly what you want.

1199
01:34:46,843 --> 01:34:47,843
Baby. Baby.

1200
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:52,514
Baby. It’s just a nightmare.

1201
01:34:53,139 --> 01:34:55,104
It’s just a bad dream.

1202
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:56,679
I’m here.

1203
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:08,827
Miss me?

1204
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:19,861
I’ll put the kids to sleep
and then we can kick in?

1205
01:35:21,066 --> 01:35:22,552
Yeah?

1206
01:35:24,521 --> 01:35:28,342
I can’t change what I did. And neither can you!

1207
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:30,714
He married me.

1208
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,434
It’s not real.

1209
01:35:33,516 --> 01:35:35,289
I killed the Bat.

1210
01:35:35,166 --> 01:35:36,945
No homie, you don’t want that.

1211
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:38,891
What? I want that.

1212
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:43,015
- She’s trying to play games with you man. It’s not real!
- He’s right.

1213
01:35:43,185 --> 01:35:44,639
It’s not real.

1214
01:35:47,022 --> 01:35:50,035
How long have you been able to see?

1215
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:52,079
My whole life.

1216
01:35:53,076 --> 01:35:55,009
You can’t have them.

1217
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,565
These are my people right here.

1218
01:35:56,582 --> 01:35:58,463
But it is our time.

1219
01:35:58,576 --> 01:36:01,406
The sun is setting and the magic rises.

1220
01:36:01,287 --> 01:36:03,687
The met humans are a sign of change.

1221
01:36:04,683 --> 01:36:05,683
Lady ...

1222
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:08,565
You are EVIL!

1223
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:10,231
Brother.

1224
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:12,254
make them bow to me.

1225
01:36:13,179 --> 01:36:14,179
Oh wow!

1226
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:18,639
Uh-oh!

1227
01:36:19,386 --> 01:36:20,386
Who's this?

1228
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:22,381
It’s gonna be bad!

1229
01:36:22,381 --> 01:36:23,860
We should run.

1230
01:36:35,232 --> 01:36:37,194
GQ, come in. we’re in position.

1231
01:36:46,354 --> 01:36:48,810
We gotta get him in that corner
That’s where the bomb will be.

1232
01:36:48,815 --> 01:36:50,883
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1233
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:06,620
I lost one family.
I ain't gonaa lose one another.

1234
01:37:06,628 --> 01:37:07,850
Look, think it through ...

1235
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,060
I got this.

1236
01:37:09,546 --> 01:37:11,746
Let me show you what I really am.

1237
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,340
Over here!

1238
01:37:56,986 --> 01:37:57,986
Go!

1239
01:38:12,036 --> 01:38:13,885
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1240
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:16,009
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1241
01:38:30,523 --> 01:38:32,256
Get him mate.
- Come on.

1242
01:38:33,602 --> 01:38:35,212
Yeah, do it.

1243
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:47,770
Diablo, get clear
Get out of there!

1244
01:38:47,853 --> 01:38:49,317
Blow it!

1245
01:38:52,267 --> 01:38:53,633
Blow it.

1246
01:38:55,999 --> 01:38:56,999
Now GQ, now.

1247
01:38:57,335 --> 01:38:58,335
NO!

1248
01:39:00,128 --> 01:39:01,128
Everybody down!

1249
01:39:02,959 --> 01:39:04,988
Now you’re screwed.

1250
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:12,817
Brother!

1251
01:39:39,283 --> 01:39:40,283
You next.

1252
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:45,210
My spell is complete.

1253
01:39:45,345 --> 01:39:49,182
Once you and armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1254
01:39:49,257 --> 01:39:53,060
And it would be mine to rule.

1255
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,167
That was our main satellite uplink.

1256
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:16,976
How did this witch even know how to target this thing?

1257
01:40:16,984 --> 01:40:19,002
It’s a secret facility.

1258
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,215
You got a move here, Flag?

1259
01:40:25,349 --> 01:40:27,742
We gotta cut her heart out.

1260
01:40:58,546 --> 01:40:59,800
While we’re fighting ...

1261
01:40:59,802 --> 01:41:02,545
that thing is laying waste to the whole damn world.

1262
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:10,658
Where is she?

1263
01:41:11,247 --> 01:41:12,247
I don’t know

1264
01:41:17,062 --> 01:41:18,062
Hey.

1265
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:26,062
Look out look out!

1266
01:41:50,314 --> 01:41:51,314
Sorry.

1267
01:41:57,165 --> 01:41:58,165
Flag!

1268
01:42:32,766 --> 01:42:34,436
Enough!

1269
01:42:37,674 --> 01:42:40,224
Of all who have faced me ...

1270
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:43,062
you have earned mercy.

1271
01:42:43,141 --> 01:42:45,627
For the last time ...

1272
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:47,537
join me ...

1273
01:42:47,649 --> 01:42:49,371
or die.

1274
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,842
I’m not much of a joiner ...

1275
01:42:55,029 --> 01:42:57,372
but maybe we should.

1276
01:42:57,499 --> 01:42:58,962
Hey.

1277
01:42:58,963 --> 01:43:00,700
she’s trying to take over the world.

1278
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:01,695
So?

1279
01:43:02,339 --> 01:43:04,618
What’s the world ever
done for us anyway?

1280
01:43:04,735 --> 01:43:05,961
It hates us.

1281
01:43:06,516 --> 01:43:08,564
Hey Harley!

1282
01:43:11,541 --> 01:43:13,406
Hey lady?

1283
01:43:15,882 --> 01:43:18,180
I lost my Puddin'.

1284
01:43:19,351 --> 01:43:21,629
But you can get him back, right?

1285
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:24,506
I can, my dear.

1286
01:43:24,805 --> 01:43:27,871
Anything you want.

1287
01:43:30,565 --> 01:43:31,425
You promise?

1288
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,572
Yes. child.

1289
01:43:35,193 --> 01:43:36,995
you need only Bow ...

1290
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:41,949
and serve beneath my feet.

1291
01:43:46,497 --> 01:43:49,013
I like what you’re sellin' lady.

1292
01:43:49,762 --> 01:43:53,382
There’s only one teeny problem.

1293
01:43:54,502 --> 01:43:56,276
You messed with my friends.

1294
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:04,068
Her heart’s out!
We can ends this.

1295
01:44:08,483 --> 01:44:09,483
Hey, Croc!

1296
01:44:13,511 --> 01:44:14,946
Harley!

1297
01:44:59,124 --> 01:45:01,646
Please Daddy, Don’t do it.

1298
01:45:02,764 --> 01:45:07,059
The only way for us to be together
is if you don’t pull the trigger.

1299
01:45:07,703 --> 01:45:09,447
Daddy I love you.

1300
01:45:10,284 --> 01:45:12,661
Please don’t do this.

1301
01:46:07,038 --> 01:46:08,459
That was a great shot man.

1302
01:46:08,459 --> 01:46:10,863
Hey, I don’t do hugs. I’m not a hugger.

1303
01:46:10,863 --> 01:46:13,781
I’m not a hugger. All right?

1304
01:46:20,143 --> 01:46:22,608
Let me join my brother.

1305
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:24,751
Katana, no!

1306
01:46:30,108 --> 01:46:31,108
Give me that.

1307
01:46:33,237 --> 01:46:34,571
you bring June back.

1308
01:46:34,804 --> 01:46:35,942
you bring her back.

1309
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:38,208
She's not coming back.

1310
01:46:38,437 --> 01:46:39,339
I'll crush this.

1311
01:46:39,466 --> 01:46:40,576
Do you hear me?

1312
01:46:40,689 --> 01:46:42,550
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1313
01:46:43,012 --> 01:46:44,724
Go ahead.

1314
01:46:45,277 --> 01:46:47,489
You don't have the balls.

1315
01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,562
Hey, Flag.

1316
01:47:51,073 --> 01:47:52,079
June!

1317
01:48:01,436 --> 01:48:03,213
She's gone.

1318
01:48:03,261 --> 01:48:04,851
I though killed you.

1319
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:06,748
I thought I killed you.

1320
01:48:07,744 --> 01:48:13,045
Y'all don't mind.
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1321
01:48:13,162 --> 01:48:15,610
yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.

1322
01:48:15,735 --> 01:48:17,187
I'm going to hotwire a car
Need a ride?

1323
01:48:17,216 --> 01:48:18,550
you are not driving.

1324
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:19,650
Why not?

1325
01:48:22,534 --> 01:48:24,573
How are you not dead?

1326
01:48:25,146 --> 01:48:27,285
We just saved the world.

1327
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:29,762
A "thank you" would be nice.

1328
01:48:30,109 --> 01:48:31,588
Thank you.

1329
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:33,158
You're welcome.

1330
01:48:33,362 --> 01:48:35,363
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1331
01:48:35,617 --> 01:48:38,180
Ten years off you prison sentences.

1332
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:44,297
Nah. that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1333
01:48:46,508 --> 01:48:48,003
That can be arranged.

1334
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:50,812
Ant other requests?

1335
01:48:51,447 --> 01:48:53,315
An espresso machine.

1336
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:55,558
BET.

1337
01:48:55,934 --> 01:48:58,825
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1338
01:48:58,834 --> 01:49:00,739
Darling, I'm walking out of here
a free man. .

1339
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:02,745
Or we're to start having some real fun.

1340
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:05,887
Why don't have some fun?

1341
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:17,593
You're trying to figure out this length.

1342
01:49:18,081 --> 01:49:19,448
That's the hypotenuse.

1343
01:49:19,888 --> 01:49:21,286
So you have to know this angle.

1344
01:49:21,526 --> 01:49:24,211
Okay. So, if you're up here ...

1345
01:49:24,236 --> 01:49:25,655
like an a building ...

1346
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:29,086
And you shoot a man down here
an the street ...

1347
01:49:29,138 --> 01:49:31,430
That's how far the bullet actually goes?

1348
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:34,153
Yeah. That's ... that's right!

1349
01:49:34,364 --> 01:49:35,800
Tou are so smart, Right.

1350
01:49:35,804 --> 01:49:38,106
the hypotenuse, good one.

1351
01:49:39,225 --> 01:49:41,141
So that would make you
have to know the angle ...

1352
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:43,678
Between the building and the sidewalk.

1353
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,409
You got to know that angle.

1354
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:47,065
No, I mean, in real life ...

1355
01:49:47,065 --> 01:49:48,118
You have variables.

1356
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,667
you know. you got rifling twist.

1357
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:52,284
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1358
01:49:52,838 --> 01:49:56,798
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the ...

1359
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,335
It's time.

1360
01:49:59,606 --> 01:50:00,606
... Wind effect.

1361
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:04,657
You know, there's a lot variables ...

1362
01:50:05,528 --> 01:50:07,226
In the street.

1363
01:50:10,769 --> 01:50:12,274
I gotta go.

1364
01:50:12,841 --> 01:50:14,174
Are you coming back?

1365
01:50:16,071 --> 01:50:17,071
Yeah.

1366
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:19,801
I'm working it out. All right?

1367
01:50:19,802 --> 01:50:24,669
You know, promised my friends
that i would just, you know, go ...

1368
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:26,602
Without  killing them all.

1369
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:27,867
Bring in it.

1370
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:32,114
I love you. Daddy.

1371
01:50:34,971 --> 01:50:36,450
I love you.

1372
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:04,932
Hey! Let me out!

1373
01:51:04,932 --> 01:51:06,855
Let me out of here right now!

1374
01:51:07,165 --> 01:51:10,339
Hey! you feel that? yeah.

1375
01:51:10,612 --> 01:51:14,259
Let me out of here. darling, please.
please, I'm begging you. Seriously.

1376
01:51:14,259 --> 01:51:17,589
Listen to me. have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1377
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:19,500
Come on!

1378
01:52:13,765 --> 01:52:15,606
Puddin''!

1379
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:20,150
Let's go home.

Listen, I can keep a secret, OK?
What do you want?

1384
01:54:56,553 --> 01:54:59,255
People have asked questions about MidWay city.

1385
01:54:59,379 --> 01:55:00,883
The kind of people can get the answers,

1386
01:55:01,027 --> 01:55:03,929
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike

1387
01:55:04,321 --> 01:55:08,312
Consider yourself under my protection. If you deliver.

1388
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:26,173
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1389
01:55:28,575 --> 01:55:30,004
It likes to make friends.

1390
01:55:31,998 --> 01:55:33,060
It's the difference between us

1391
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:33,938
You believe in friendship.

1392
01:55:33,938 --> 01:55:35,167
I believe in the leverage.

1393
01:55:36,503 --> 01:55:37,631
Goodnight.

1394
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:38,867
You look tired.

1395
01:55:39,868 --> 01:55:41,702
You should stop working at nights.

1396
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:47,547
You should shout it down,
or my friends and I will for ya'
